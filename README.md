# Akai Fire Virtual Device / Interface

## Synopsis

This is an implementation for commanding the Akai Fire Midi Controller.
For my own purpose I use it to control Apples Logic Pro X(TM)

## Functionality

Connecting the Akai Fire to your computer and running this python program you will 
have a Virtual Mididevice 'Akai Fire Virtual Mapper' at your disposal in you Mididaw.
It can highlight all the soft buttons (RGB values), hard buttons (yellow, red, green).
It can write info text onto the OLED display.
Reads the verious pots and select knob.
It understands Midi sync messages.
